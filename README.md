An individual investor plans to invest all or a portion of an inheritance on several alternative 
investments, consisting of municipal bonds (MB), certificates of deposit (CD), treasury bills (TB), and 
growth stock funds (SF). The anticipated annual return of each investment is given in table 1 below:
Asset Anticipated Annual 

Return
MB 5.5%

CD 6.5%

TB 7.0%

SF 14.0%

Table 1: Annual Returns of Investments
Each investment has a different perceived risk to the investor; thus the investor plans to diversify 
according to the following guidelines:

• At least 10% but no more than 20% of the total investment should be allocated to municipal 
bonds.

• The amount invested in CD s should not exceed the average of the other three investment 
alternatives. 

• At least 30% of the total investment should consist of treasury bills or stock funds. 

• More should be invested in certificates of deposit and treasury bills compared to the combined 
investment of the other two alternatives, by a ratio of at least 3 to 2.

Use linear programming to help the investor decide how to allocate his/her initial investment in each 
alternative so that the investment’s annual return is maximized.
